Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for data compression. The algorithm reads an input text file, compresses the content using Huffman coding, and writes both the encoded and decoded data to files. Additionally, it compares the sizes of the original and encoded files to verify the effectiveness of the compression.
