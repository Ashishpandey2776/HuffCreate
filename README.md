Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for data compression. The algorithm reads an input text file, compresses the content using Huffman coding, and writes both the encoded and decoded data to files. Additionally, it compares the sizes of the original and encoded files to verify the effectiveness of the compression.

Features
Reads input text from a file
Builds a Huffman tree based on character frequencies
Encodes the text using the Huffman tree
Writes the encoded data to a binary file
Decodes the encoded data back to text
Writes the decoded text to a file
Compares and displays the sizes of the original and encoded files

Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
C++ standard library

File Structure
main.cpp: The main implementation file
input.txt: The input text file to be compressed
encoded.bin: The binary file containing the encoded data
decoded.txt: The file containing the decoded text
